Solve the following requirements using Classical School or Inside Out.
If you discover the need for a collaborator that doesn't exist yet, create it first and apply relevant tests to it.
Then proceed with the initial requirement.

Use simple objects as collaborators here. I don't expect you to actually send emails or collect payments!!

The booking should collect payment from the users bank.
If the payment is unsuccessful, then the booking should not be accepted.
If the booking is cancelled up to 60 days before the booking date, the money should be refunded.
If the booking is cancelled up to 30 days before the booking, 75 percent of the booking price should be refunded.
If the booking is cancelled up to 7 days before the booking, 50 percent of the booking price should be refunded.
When the booking user supplies an email, a booking confirmation should be sent to the user.
When the booking user supplies an email and a payment fails, a failed payment email should be sent to the user.
When the booking user supplies an email and a cancellation is successful, a cancellation email should be sent to the user.
When the booking user supplies an email and a cancellation fails, an explanation email should be sent to the user.
Successul bookings should be placed on a message bus for distribution to integration partners (e.g hotel).
Cancelled bookings should be placed on a message bus for distribution to our integration partners.
